# REP3
rep3 report for the James Webb telescope 

This Code is to be used by the research group in REP3 at Bristol University for finding the trajectory of the optimised path of the James Webb telescope
to minimise fuel consumption.

There are different files to be run where each performs a task to numerically solve the Euler Lagrange equations for the James Webb at L3
